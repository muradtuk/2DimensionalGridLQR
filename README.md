# 2DimensionalGridLQR

In this repository, you will find our MATLAB implementation for solving the LQR problem on grid of states. We use an implementation of Newton Raphson Optimization which uses symbolic math. See Newton Raphson Optimization by Symbolic Math (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/53422-newton-raphson-optimization-by-symbolic-math), MATLAB Central File Exchange.
